**UPDATE:**
I've already given up on this because discord.py seems to have been created out of pure hatred and malice and just completely breaks the python async system rendering any top-level async or any attempts to shut down discord.py outside of it's message loop useless. Thanks, discord.py! Now I can go back to C# and make some actual working software with an actual functioning language ecosystem in a language with a sane async system!

Really bad discord bot written in a really bad programming language.
